# stockflow-inventory-case-study

This repository contains my solutions to the StockFlow B2B Inventory Management System case study.

I approached this problem from a system design, data logic, and business reasoning perspective rather than deep backend implementation. The focus is on identifying issues, understanding real-world constraints, and proposing scalable and maintainable solutions.

## Structure
- Part 1: Code Review & Debugging – Identifying issues and production impact
- Part 2: Database Design – Schema design and missing requirements
- Part 3: Low Stock Alerts – API logic, edge cases, and assumptions

## Technologies
- Conceptual backend logic
- Python-level understanding
- SQL / PL-pgSQL concepts
- System design and data modelling

## Notes
Code is intentionally minimal. Emphasis is placed on reasoning, clarity, and business understanding.
